# H-1B-Analysis

In this project, we will analyze and find trends about where the applicants are hired, what field they are hired in, and where the demand lies for skilled foreign workers. 

H-1B visas are given to skilled foreign workers to grant them the opportunity to work within the USA for a specified amount of time. Furthermore, companies are also able to sponsor these foreign workers as long as certain educational and work experience criterias are met.

The dataset for this project originates from the U.S. Department of Labor Site and provided through
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/abrambeyer/h1b-visa-petitions-20152019">Kaggle</a>. This dataset includes 857216 entries of aggregated data from 2015-2019 H-1B applications including but not limited to destination, titles held, companies, and case status throughout the United States.
